Project song
"Ti e Do Drejtësinë" is the third song from the double album with the same title.

In the song's introduction, the verse refers to its title and the album itself and continues to preach.
In the first verse, it is shown that we should leave this time, to be suitable and to fulfill all that is right in this way and then preach.

The verse then refers to a symbolic tent such as this we need: faithful, blameless, undefiled, and separated from sin, higher than the heavens hating iniquity.

In the next verse, however, I will say:
'I never knew you, and depart from me, you who work iniquity'. Slowly here I start and get into the meaning of the song and the album all about the one who loves justice and hates lawlessness.
Then the verse shows a girlfriend, your girlfriend who loves you passionately more than your friends.
You chuckle, referring to her only friend again, your friend Maria.
The verse continues that she does not tighten. Not yet attached to the plot. But the metaphor of the poem then fits with a visit to the Louvre museum. This plot of her illustrated with your credit cards, for my smoke, for your music, for marriage.

Then the verse becomes more illuminating by showing the famous physicist Isaac Newton who is above me, and the least of a thousand, to tell the good news to the meek, to bind up the wound of the murderous, to proclaim liberty to them who are in captivity, to fully open the eyes of the prisoners.
The verse even exhorts friends and enemies, along with the people who gather to deny, the oppressed of the Devil, that is, counsel and power, the power of the third key, which permeates every night club, doing good by healing the oppressed on the day off on the Sabbath because no one can perform these signs.

The verse then exults, to always be strong, and to feel happy with girls, more than your friends.

I continue in the verse by referring to Rock N' Roll star Elvis Presley as the reigning king, rather than the stars. He was successful and everyone obeyed him. Then the verse of the song prays for what we don't know that MTV up itself, is more magical than the music itself.
In the last verse, the song is in contradiction to thinking about how we can face the work of Mozart who has in hand the ninth symphony, a great creation, and not tire ourselves in vain by reaping hardships. How long will the wicked be in innocence?

At the end of the song I share how I was inspired by some famous historical figures for my stage name mentioning Dionysius the Areopagite, Saint-Denis, otherwise known as Cry War, and my stage name Deny D.
